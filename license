Please note that I am really flexible with allowing the usage of the content in this
repository. If you reach out to me with a brief detail of why and how you would like
to use this content, there is a good chance that I will allow you to use it. The reason
behind this strictness in the license is to stop the people who have been using these
roadmaps in ill manners e.g. ripping people off with suggesting random affiliate links,
redistributing these roadmaps just for the sake of monetizing the traffic.
